Title: Gem Maze Adventure

Description: Gem Maze Adventure is a fun and engaging web browser game where players navigate through a randomly generated maze to collect hidden green gems. 
The objective is to collect all the gems scattered throughout the maze while avoiding the maze walls. The game features a player character that can be moved using the arrow keys, 
and a counter that tracks the number of gems left to collect. Once all gems are collected, a congratulatory message appears, and the player can choose to reset the game and play again.

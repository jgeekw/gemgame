    <h1>Gem Maze Adventure</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Gem Maze Adventure is a fun and engaging web browser game where players navigate through a randomly generated maze to collect hidden green gems. The objective is to collect all the gems scattered throughout the maze while avoiding the maze walls. The game features a player character that can be moved using the arrow keys, and a counter that tracks the number of gems left to collect. Once all gems are collected, a congratulatory message appears, and the player can choose to reset the game and play again.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Collect all the green gems hidden within the maze.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the player character.</li>
        <li><strong>Maze Navigation:</strong> The player must navigate through the maze without colliding with the walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Gem Collection:</strong> Each time the player moves over a gem, it is collected, and the gem counter decreases.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> When all gems are collected, a message will appear congratulating the player. The player can then choose to reset the game and start a new maze.</li>
        <li><strong>Debug Feature:</strong> For testing purposes, pressing the <code>C</code> key will automatically collect all the gems and display the congratulatory message.</li>
    </ul>
